title: d3.js Data Driven Visualisation Part I
---
# Overview

Before diving into the topic of Data Visualisation, it's worth asking why. What is it about the topic that makes it worthy of discussion? Fundamentally, this boils down to two points:

- Data is often rife with complexity
- Observations derived from data may also be difficult to convey

Intuitively, it has been stated that  well encoded visualisations can lead to more accurate judgement and perceptions of patterns in data. Therefore, finding a proper visual encoding to comprehend and convey meaning from data is of paramount importance to the discovery process.

> The graphical form that involves elementary perceptual tasks that lead to more accurate judgement than another graphical form (with the same quantitative information) will result in a better organization in increase the chances of a correct perception of patterns and behavior. - William S. Cleveland

d3.js (Data-Driven Documents), which is the tool we will employ here, is a merely a low-level mechanism we will use to understand, encode and convey meaning from our data.

## Visual Encoding Techniques

A good representation is often one that is both simple and aligned with 'human perception'. 

An example which tackles this criteria is shown below. It is a diagram by the famous Florence Nightingale demonstrating the different causes of mortality in the Army grouped by causes and months over a two year period.

![Florence Nightingale](/assets/d3/nightingale.jpg "Florence Nightingale - Causes of Mortality in the Army")

Upon inspection, the message Florence was trying to convey is immediately apparent. There is no 'chart-junk' (coined by Edward R. Tufte) masking the data's message, the graph type is familiar, and the visualisation is easy to interpret through colour & size comparisons which naturally lend themselves to human interpretation. The result of all this ensures that the data is correctly interpreted and results are clearly demonstrated.

The choice of encoding will be affected by quirks of the dataset and it's intended message. Cleveland & McGill (1984) proposed guidelines for choosing an encoding based on the function of the display. Perhaps you are trying to convey positional data, lengths, angles, area(s), shading, curves or volumetric data. Cleveland & McGill (1984) took an in-depth look at how well the human brain can make comparisons and detect differences between encodings; the key idea is that you want to choose an encoding which suits the dataset, intended use and makes it easy for the human brain to interpret.

As a final counter-example, consider the table below. If I asked you to consider which of Sweden or Spain had higher fertility rates between a given period, is this easy to derive?

Perhaps it is not us at fault, but rather the choice of encoding. Is the following representation easier to reason about? The point is that there is no one size fits all solution. You must consider the nature of the data and message that you are trying to convey in order to choose an effective encoding.

## Abstraction vs. Control

In the case of visualisation, there is often a trade-off between abstraction and control. Tableau is an example of the abstract end of the spectrum; it provides many features out of the box but lacks the control to tailor results to our needs. d3 sits on the other end of the spectrum and makes direct use of low-level HTML elements such as SVG and Canvas to exert control with (some) abstraction. In the context of cooking, Tableau is to a muffin as d3 is to a whisk and HTML/SVG/Canvas is to raw ingredients.

## Elements of d3.js

Below is an example of a simple SVG element to render a rectangle in the browser:
{% highlight html %}
<html>
<svg width='500' height='500'>
<rect y='10' x='10' height='100px' width='100px' fill='red'></rect>
</svg>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

As a taster, here is the same represented using d3:
{% highlight javascript %}
d3.select('body')
           .append('svg')
           .attr('height', 500)
           .attr('width', 500);
var rect = svg.append('rect')
               .attr('height', 100)
               .attr('width', 100)
               .attr('fill', 'red')
               .attr('x', 10)
               .attr('y', 10);
{% endhighlight %}

Right away, we notice the declarative approach of d3; we express what we want to select & manipulate rather than how to do it. The following sections will tackle the elements which form the core of d3.

### Selections

A selection is simply an array of elements pulled from an HTML document. Selections allow you to pick out and manipulate groups of elements of in an HTML document that are of interest in a declarative fashion. The key difference here to traditional approaches is that we don't have to express convoluted logic to loop over elements of the DOM and interact with elements one-by-one. Instead we can use selections to modify groups of DOM elements without the need for recursion or iteration.

We have already seen one example where we selected the body element and appended an SVG rectangle element. Once you have the desired set of selections in hand, we can apply various operators to manipulate the DOM elements. The main ones to be aware of are: append, remove, attr and data for adding, removing, modifying and data binding respectively.

Selections can also be performed on: class (".x"), unique identifier ("#y"), attribute ("[color=red]"), or by containment ("parent child").

### Joins

This is perhaps the most fundamental part of d3 and underpins the title 'Data-Driven Documents'. The key point is that every element in d3 (e.g. an SVG rectangle) can be bound to a corresponding data item.

Suppose we have an HTML document with two rect elements as per the below:
{% highlight html %}
<rect ... fill='red'> </rect>
<rect ... fill='red'> </rect>
{% endhighlight %}

With the corresponding d3:
{% highlight javascript %}
var array = [30, 40, 20];
var rect = svg.selectAll('rect')
	.data(array)
	.attr('fill', 'blue');
{% endhighlight %}

The call to data(array) here 'binds' the array to the selection 'rects'. This means that each element (30, 40, 20 ...) is paired with a corresponding rect in the selection. The result of this example is that 30 is bound to the first rect (rect 1), 40 to rect2 and their fill attribute is modified to blue. 

A natural question is what happens when the array length does not equal the number of rect elements in the document? In fact this example has surplus elements in array that are not bound to an object... Perhaps we want to treat these elements differently. In order to distinguish between the two we can use the enter() operator:
{% highlight javascript %}
var array = [30, 40, 20];
var rect = svg.selectAll('rect')
	.data(array)
	.enter()
	.append('rect')
	.attr('fill', 'blue')
	.attr('width', ...)
    .attr('height', ...)
	.attr('x', ...)
    .attr('y', ...);
{% endhighlight %}

Now the behaviour has changed. The enter() selection will select the surplus element pairs (20 in this case). The result of this is that new rectangles are appended for each surplus element in the array with the fill colour blue. 

Conversely, when there are more HTML elements than data elements, we can use the exit() selection instead as shown below:
{% highlight html %}
<rect ... fill='red'> </rect>
<rect ... fill='red'> </rect>
<rect ... fill='blue'> </rect>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var array = [30];
var rect = svg.selectAll('rect')
        .data(array)
		.exit()
		.remove()
{% endhighlight %}

One last important note is that binding occurs by index by default - this means there is no object constancy. If elements are removed, the new element in a given index will bind to the original DOM element. To alleviate this issue, you can specify a second parameter to the data function to define how to bind data to elements (for example by key).

### Scales & Axes

d3 supports the use of scales to project a domain into a set range. For example:
{% highlight javascript %}
var array = [1000, 5000, 10000];
var c = d3.scale.linear()
                 .domain([1000,10000])
                 .range(['green', 'red']);
svg.selectAll('rect').data().enter()
        .attr('fill', function(d) {return c(d)})
{% endhighlight %}

Here the source array is scaled (linearly) from the domain of 1000-10000 to the range of green to red. What's special here is that d3 is intelligent enough to interpolate the domain as colours. The result is that our rect elements fill colour can be mapped to a range of colours depending on the dataset without expressing explicit RGB values.

It's all well and good having selections, joins and scaling at hand - but how can we generate axes for our charts? A simple example is shown below:
{% highlight javascript %}
var axis = d3.svg.axis().scale(x).orient('bottom');
svg.append('g')
        .attr('transform', 'translate(0,50)')
        .call(axis);
{% endhighlight %}
In order to avoid part of the axes/data rendering off-screen, it is convention to append a new element within a margin as follows:



### External Data - A real world example

In order to do anything interesting with d3, we will likely need to deal with external data such as a CSV file. In order to do so we will need a simple HTTP server to expose the file for d3 to access it; we will use a simple Python SimpleHTTPServer for this purpose.

To tie together the material thus far, we will deal with a real world example on data from the titanic.

Before running the example ensure you have launched an HTTP server in the parent directory with:
{% highlight bash %}
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
{% endhighlight %}

Source code to load & visualise the dataset:
{% highlight javascript %}
var svg = d3.select('body')
.append('svg')
.attr('width', width + margin.left + margin.right)
.attr('height', height + margin.top + margin.bottom)
.append('g')
.attr('transform', 'translate('+ margin.left +',' + margin.top +')');

var x = d3.scale.linear()
	.domain([0,80])
	.range([0,width])

var y = d3.scale.log()
	.domain([6,500])
	.range([height, 0])

var c = d3.scale.ordinal()
	.domain([1,2,3])
	.range(['#ff4d4d','#00cc66','orange'])                                                  
var axisX = d3.svg.axis().scale(x).orient('bottom')
var axisY = d3.svg.axis().scale(y).orient('left')

svg.selectAll('circle')
	.data(data)
	.enter()
    .append('g')
    .append('circle')
	.attr('cx', function(d) {return  x(d.Age)})
	.attr('cy', function(d) {return y(d.Fare)})
   	.attr('r', function(d) {return 3 + 2*d.Survived})
	.attr('fill', function(d) {return c(d.Pclass)})

svg.append('g')
	.attr('class', 'axis')
	.attr('transform', 'translate( 0,' + height +')')
	.call(axisX)

svg.append('g')
	.attr('class', 'axis')
	.call(axisY)
});
{% endhighlight %}

The example above will plot the following:
![Titanic](/assets/d3/titanic.png "Titanic")

Age is represented on the x-axis and fare price on the y-axis. The colours represent the class of passenger and the radius of each circle indicated whether or not they survived (larger meaning yes). 

### Transitions & Event Handling

Not only do we want to represent visualisations in a declarative and data-driven manner, but we'd also like to enable dynamic visualisations. For example, when a user clicks a button trigger an animation. Transitions enable us to do this and can largely be thought of as selections over time.

A simple transition is demonstrated below:
{% highlight javascript %}
d3.selectAll('circle')
    .transition()
	.duration(500)
  	.attr('cy', 300)
  	.attr('fill','red')
  	.each('end‘, function(){ 
          d3.selectAll('circle') 
  			.transition()
			.duration(500)
			.attr('cy', 100)
			.attr('fill','blue');
	});
{% endhighlight %}

This will gradually transition a circle from y=100 to y=300 and modify it's colour to red from blue. On the end of this transition it will trigger a second transition to return the circle to it's original location and colour.

If you want to react to user events such as mouse clicks you can make use of the .on() operator. Examples of events that are supported include:

- 'click' 
- 'dblclick' 
- 'mouseover' 
- 'mousemove' 
- 'mouseout' 
- 'dragstart' 
- 'dragend'
- 'drag'
- 'zoom'
... and other Javascript event types

## Conclusion
I hope you found this post informative. To recap, we've touched on what makes a good visualisation, techniques to effectively encode data and on the basics of the d3.js library. We looked at selections, joins, scales, axes, loading data, transitions & events with examples of how to apply them in practice.
